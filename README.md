# ESP32 Weather-OLED
 small program to display weather and indoor temperature information
 very basic still, you need to fill in all the "BLANK" follwing the instructions
 as of now, it will only work properly on a 128x64 SSD1306/1315 display and with an DHT11, but stuff can be easily modified for compatibility with other devices
